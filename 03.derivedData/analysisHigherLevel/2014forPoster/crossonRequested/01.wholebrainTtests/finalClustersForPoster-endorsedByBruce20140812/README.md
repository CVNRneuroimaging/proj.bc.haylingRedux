These are the clusters used for Bruce's 2014 poster
===============================================
Bruce's 2014 poster describes data from clusters he derived from whole-brain
t-tests. His AFNI-generated cluster map is in this directory as
`finalClusterMaskFromBruce.OLDvYOUNGforB-A.nii.gz`. 

For visualizaiton I split that multi-intensity cluster map into individual
files for his five clusters of interest, with intensities binarized to 1's and
0's: `cluster?.bin1.nii.gz`.


WARNING: incorrectly named files
================================= 

The cluster mask & table in this directory were generated by the AFNI GUI when
Bruce had the wrong filename in the GUI file name field (`YNG_Bv0*`). I left them
here with there original names for the sake of tracking, but also created a
descriptively named nifti copy for actual use:
`finalClusterMaskFromBruce.OLDvYOUNGforB-A.nii.gz`

Proof: look at the embeded AFNI command-line history in the BRIK/HEAD
image you'll see that the results were generated from the correct whole-brain
ttest map: `ttest.oldvsyoung.taskB-A.nii.gz`

I also copied the stdout from the GUI and pasted it below:
